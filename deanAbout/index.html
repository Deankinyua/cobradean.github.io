              As a dedicated software developer with a knack for problem solving
              I have honed my skills in both frontend and backend development.
              My journey in the world of programming began with a fascination
              for turning ideas into functional, user centric applications.

              My Analytical thinking capabilities make it is easy for me to
              break down these problems into manageable components, analyze the
              root causes, and devise effective solutions.

              Teams often consist of individuals with different backgrounds,
              skills, and experiences.My collaboration with all stakeholders
              allows for the integration of diverse perspectives, leading to
              more comprehensive problem-solving and innovative ideas.

            <h3>Swimming Instructor</h3>
            <p>
              Besides the tedious world of programming, I dedicate my weekends
              on the Pools teaching others how to swim effectively and get less
              tired with more distance. Swimming is also a brilliant way of
              relaxing oneself and if you try you would probably enjoy it as
              much as I do.Reach me via the WhatsApp I have provided above.
